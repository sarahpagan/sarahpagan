# Project 2

## NPS API Vignette

My goal for this project was to write a vignette for contacting the National Parks Service API. I have created several functions to retrieve data on NPS parks and their activities, campgrounds and fees.

- My project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/sarahpagan/558-project2).

- My vignette is rendered on github-pages [here](https://sarahpagan.github.io/558-project2/).
