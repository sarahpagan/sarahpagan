# Project 3 Reflections

Our final project is rendered [here](https://sarahpagan.github.io/558-project3/). 

The project repository lives [here](https://github.com/sarahpagan/558-project3).

## What would you do differently?

For the logistic regression model, I chose three models I was interested in exploring without much prior analysis (besides EDA). I think I should have considered performing best subset regression using `regsubsets` or stepwise regression to identify candidate models train.

## What was the most difficult part for you?

The most difficult part of the project for me was identifying a third model type I wanted to consider. I was interested in performing some type of boosted logistic regression, but still have a hard time wrapping my head around the boosting algorithm. I ultimately went with a model I was able to implement and write about.

## What are your big take-aways from this project?

1. This was my first experience automating RMarkdown -- it was an easier process than I anticipated and I can see it's use in my professional work.
2. The best LASSO lambda parameter was 0 in most cases. This means no shrinkage? Not really a takeaway, but I want to understand why this was the result. I am wondering if we should have excluded the value of 0 from the tuning grid.
