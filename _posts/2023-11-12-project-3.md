# Project 3 Reflections

Our final project is rendered here. 

The project repository lives here.

## What would you do differently?

For the logistic regression model, I chose three models I was interested in exploring without much prior analysis (besides EDA). I think I should have considered performing best subset regression using `regsubsets` or stepwise regression to identify candidate models train.

## What was the most difficult part for you?

The most diffiuclt part of the project for me was identifying a third model type I wanetd to consider. I was interested in performing some type of boosted logistic regression, but had a hard time learning and conveying the concepts behind boosting. I ultimately went with a model I thoguht was easier to implement and write about.

## What are your big take-aways from this project?

1. This was my first experience automating RMarkdown -- it was an easier process than I anticipated and I can see it's use in my professional work.
2.
