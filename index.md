**Hi, my name is Sarah**.

I'm a Master of Statistics student at North Carolina State University and Adjunct Research Associate at the [Institute for Defense Analysis](https://www.ida.org/) (IDA) Science and Technology Policy Institute (STPI). 

Outside of work and school, I enjoy spending time hanging out with my cat and [rock climbing](https://carolinaclimbers.org/) in Western North Carolina.

This is my blog about **Data Science**.
