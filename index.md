**Hi, my name is Sarah**.

I'm a Master of Statistics student at North Carolina State University and Adjunct Research Associate at the Institute for Defense Analysis' (IDA) Science and Technology Policy Institute (STPI). 

Outside of work and school, I enjoy spending the majority of my time:

1. Rock climbing outside in Western North Carolina, and locally at the [Triangle Rock Club](https://www.instagram.com/trianglerockclub/).
2. Watching sci-fi movies with my grumpy cat.

This is my blog about **Data Science**.
